## Predict survival on the Titanic

### Introduction

This is my first project that is uploaded on github so there should be much better way to predict the survivors. As for this time, I will use RandomForest to make Machine Learning model and predict test data set.


### Preparation

##### Initial works

```{r}
#Load packages
library(mice)
library(dplyr)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
```

```{r}
#Set up Working directory
setwd('c:/Kaggle/titanic')  #Location where I saved train.csv and test.csv files
```

We need to combine train.csv and test.csv files in order to fill up the missing values. I will change brank cells to NAs as it is easier to fill up the missing values.

```{r}
#Combine train.csv and test.csv files
train <- read.csv('train.csv', na.strings = c("", "NA"), stringsAsFactors = F)
test <- read.csv('test.csv', na.strings = c("", "NA"), stringsAsFactors = F)
total <- bind_rows(train, test)
```

##### Adding new column

```{r}
#make Title column
total$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', total$Name)
total$Title[total$Title == 'Mlle'] <- 'Miss'
total$Title[total$Title == 'Ms'] <- 'Miss'
total$Title[total$Title == 'Mme'] <- 'Mrs'
```
```{r}
#check title counts by sex
table(total$Sex, total$Title)
```

Now, I am going to make Family size column and Deck column.

```{r}
#make family size column that contains the passenger themselves
total$FamilySize <- total$SibSp + total$Parch + 1
#make Deck column
total$Deck <- factor(sapply(total$Cabin, function(x) strsplit(x, NULL)[[1]][1]))
```

##### Exploratory analysis

I will used Tableau for visualise our data. First of all, I will see the relationship between sex and survived.

<img src="Relationship between Sex and Survived.PNG">

As we expected, the proportion of survived female was much higher than that of male.

What does our family size variable look like? To help us understand how it may relate to survival, I will also use Tableau and plot it.

We can see that there's a survival penalty to singletons and those with family sizes above 4. We can collapse this variable into three levels which will be helpful since there are comparatively fewer large families.

##### Filling up missing values

Before imputation, I will remove some variables and change categorical to factors.

```{r}
total1 <- total[,-c(1,2,4,9,11)]
total1 <- as.data.frame(unclass(total1))
```

I will impute missing values by using Mice package.

```{r}
#imputing missing values
miceMod <- mice(total1, method="rf")
miceOutput <- complete(miceMod)
#Check whether there is missing values
colnames(miceOutput)[colSums(is.na(miceOutput)) > 0]
```

##### Separation 

I will separate back to train and test for prediction.

```{r}
#separate
train1 <- miceOutput[1:891,]
test1 <- miceOutput[892:1309,]
```


### Prediction 

I will devide train set to training and testing to check accuracy.

```{r}
#add Survived column to train1
Survived <- train$Survived
train1 <- cbind(train1,Survived)
train1$Survived <- as.factor(train1$Survived)
```

```{r}
#split train
set.seed(54321)
outcome <- train1$Survived

partition <- createDataPartition(y=outcome,
                                 p=.7,
                                 list=F)
training <- train1[partition,]
testing <- train1[-partition,]
```

I will use simple Random Forest model to predict testing and check accuracy of a model.

```{r}
#predict with Random Forest
model_1 <- randomForest(Survived ~ ., data=training)
prediction <- predict(model_1, testing)
```

```{r}
confusionMatrix(prediction, testing$Survived)
```

```{r}
#predict, save and submit
prediction <- predict(model_1, test1)
solution <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(solution, file = 'randomforest_Sol.csv', row.names = F)
```
